# 🚀 React + Vite + Tailwind CSS Starter

This is a modern, minimal, and fast boilerplate built with:

- ⚛️ **React** – for building powerful UIs  
- ⚡ **Vite** – for lightning-fast bundling and dev server  
- 🌈 **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first, responsive design

This starter is ideal for quickly bootstrapping front-end projects with clean defaults and full flexibility.
